      <h3>Build from source</h3>
      <p>
        AryaLinux is built from source code of packages, libraries and
        applications that is publicly available over the internet. This limits
        the numbers of applications that can be installed on AryaLinux, because
        there are still a lot of applications out there which are not open
        source and since AryaLinux does not have support for Wine, Windows
        applications are out of question. Being built from source however brings
        in other advantages - you get a vanilla system that has not been
        modified or patched by us. In case you build AryaLinux in your own
        system from ground up, you end up getting the most compatible Linux
        system because its built on your system itself compared to downloading
        and installing AryaLinux. There are downsides as well to being built
        from source. Installing large applications take time, especially if your
        system is not fast enough. Moreover due to the built from source nature
        of AryaLinux, uninstalling applications from AryaLinux is not an easy
        thing to do.

      <h3>AryaLinux Packaging System (alps)</h3>
      <p>
        AryaLinux ships with the alps tool which similifies the process of
        building and installing applications and libraries in AryaLinux. Having
        been heavily inspired by LFS and BLFS, applications in AryaLinux are not
        installed via binary packages (except a few). That is why there is no
        packaging system in AryaLinux. Installing from source is a difficult
        thing to do especially for people with no background in software
        development. So we have created a tool that would make the task of
        downloading, building, installing and resolving dependencies for
        applications easy. alps provides a command line interface with basic
        package management options like install, upgrade etc to easy application
        installation and update. Learn more about alps here.

      <h3>AryaLinux Build platform</h3>
      <p>
        AryaLinux is not just a distribution, AryaLinux also provides a build
        platform so that you too can build your own distribution from source.
        Being open source you are also free to remaster, respin AryaLinux to
        build your own Linux distribution. AryaLinux build scripts can be used
        to build any kind of distribution like GUI less applications which run
        on servers and distributions with custom Desktop manager build from
        independent desktop manager components and full blown distributions with
        applications and live media all with a few simple commands.
