            Documentation provided here is mostly meant for developers or anyone who is interested to know about the internals of AryaLinux in particular and Linux in general. We have tried to cover most of the things related to AryaLinux that would help someone
            understand AryaLinux in as much detail as possible as well as help in tweaking AryaLinux build scripts and build platform to suit their requirements or in creating custom builds.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since AryaLinux borrows heavily from Linux from scratch and Beyond Linux from scratch books, it would be a good idea to read them first. The documentation presented below adds to the knowledge provided in the LFS and BLFS books.
